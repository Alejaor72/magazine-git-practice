    <p>There was once a miller who, when he died, had nothing to leave to his three sons but a mill, a donkey, and a cat.

        The mill he left to his eldest son, the donkey to the second, and to the youngest he left the cat.
        
        The youngest son was very unhappy.
        
        -'Alas!' he said, 'This cat is of no use to me and I am too, poor to feed her.'
        
        -'Do not grieve, dear master,' said the cat. 'You have only to give me a bag and get a pair of boots made for me, so that I may scamper through the dirt and brambles, and you shall find that you are not so badly off as you think.'
        
        Now this surprised the miller´s son very much, and he thought to himself, a cat that can speak is perhaps wonderful enough to do as she promises. So he brought her the bag and had the boots made for her.
        
        Puss put on the boots with a proud air, slung the bag over her shoulder, and went to the garden. There she gathered some lettuces and put them into the bag.Next she went across the field until she came to a rabbit hole. Then she lay down as if dead, leaving the top of her bag open. A plump rabbit soon peeped out of the hole and, smelling the lettuce, came nearer. It was too tempting. The rabbit´s head followed his nose into the bag.
        
        The cat quickly pulled the strings and the rabbit was dead. Proud of her prey, Puss marched with it to the palace and asked to see the king. She was brought before the throne and there, with a low bow, Puss said,
        
        -'Sire, pray accept this rabbit as a gift from my lord the Marquis of Carrabas, who commanded me to present it to Your Majesty with the assurance of his respect.'
        
        -'Tell your master,' said the king, 'that I accept his gift and am much obliged.'
        
        A few days later, Puss again went to the field. Again she lay down as if dead with her sack open beside her. This time she captured two fine partridges. Again the cat went to the king and presented the partridges as she had done the rabbit. They, too, were accepted, and the king was so pleased that he ordered the cat to be taken to the kitchen and fed.</p>
